# CS2 Surf Mapping — vendored reference

**Source:** https://github.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping
**Retrieved:** 2026-08-02 (upstream `main`)
**Author:** Chent-AU and contributors. Copied here under its own terms; this is their text,
not ours.

Kept in-repo because `CLAUDE.md` points at `docs/` for "the CS surf design reference the
level is held against," and because the critic agent's job is to hold this level against real
surf maps — it should not have to go to the network every session to do that.

Two things to know before reading:

- **The upstream README *is* the whole guide.** The repository is that file plus a `media/`
  folder of GIFs. The images below are remote links to that folder: they render on GitHub and
  break offline. The GIFs are not vendored — they are megabytes, and this repo's entire asset
  footprint is otherwise zero.
- **Many sections are stubs.** Anything under a `To Include:` heading is an outline the
  authors have not written yet — zoning, lighting, vis, build/release, and most of the
  obstacle catalogue. The finished parts are ramp bugs, ramp types, ramp construction, and
  ramp aesthetics.

## What transfers to surf-proto

This is a CS2/Hammer guide. We have no Hammer, no BSP, no vis compile, and no timer plugins,
so most of its second half is inapplicable. Triaged so nobody re-reads it hunting for
relevance:

### Transfers directly

- **The ramp type taxonomy** — straight, trapezoid, reverse-trapezoid, half/full pyramid,
  slide, vertically curved, horizontally curved; each in half / full / inverted. This maps
  almost one-to-one onto `RampCurveMode` (`'straight' | 'vertical' | 'horizontal'`) plus the
  `rollDeg` / `endRollDeg` bank sweep in `src/world/RampCurve.ts`. It also names the variants
  the editor palette does *not* yet offer — trapezoid ends, pyramids, slides — which is a
  concrete backlog for `src/editor/`.
- **The obstacle catalogue** — spin, royal spin, free spin, drop strafe, ramp strafe, window,
  pillars/air-strafes, headcheck, headsurf, bhop, speedcheck. This is the vocabulary real
  surf maps are built from and a ready-made design backlog for the course.
- **"Must be > 45 degrees."** Independent confirmation of our 45.573° walkable cutoff
  (`MovementConfig.MAX_SLOPE_WALKABLE_DEG`, from Source's `normal.z >= 0.7`). A ramp shallower
  than that is a floor, in their engine and ours.
- **Ramp consistency as a readability rule** — one material and colour for every surfable
  surface, visually distinct from everything non-surfable, so players can read a route at
  speed. That is a design principle, not a Hammer technique, and applies to any renderer.

### Confirms how we already build ramps

The guide constructs curved ramps as a chain of duplicated segments, each rotated a constant
few degrees from the last (its worked example uses 5° per segment), with vertices aligned so
the segments meet cleanly. That is exactly what `buildRampCurve` does, with `angleStepDeg`
defaulting to 4 and edges kept coincident to avoid seams that would kick the player's
velocity. Our approach matches shipped practice — worth knowing before anyone "optimises" it.

### Does not transfer

- **Ramp bugs and their fixes.** A CS2-specific artefact: sub-0.06-unit invisible slopes
  generated at mesh triangle edges when the map loads. We have no BSP and no mesh loader —
  our surfaces are oriented boxes registered from the same loop that builds the meshes, and
  velocity is clipped by our own `clipVelocity`. The failure mode does not exist here.
- `toolsplayerclip`, physics types (`Mesh` / `Multiple Convex Hulls` / `None`), face
  thickening, clip/body separation — all Hammer workflow for a compiled BSP.
- Vis hints, lighting compilation and compression, moondomes and fake skyboxes.
- Zoning, timer plugin zones, trigger/teleport entities, exploit prevention — we have one
  checkpoint system in `Game`, not a server plugin.
- Workshop deployment and server access.

# Ramps
### Ramp Bugs
Ramp bugs are a significant challenge in CS2 surf mapping, often disrupting player momentum and leading to frustrating gameplay experiences. Unlike in Source 1, where ramp bugs typically result in players getting stuck or abruptly stopping, CS2 introduces new behaviors where velocity can be unpredictably redirected, causing players to veer off course or lose speed unexpectedly.​
#### Causes of Ramp Bugs
According to the [CS2KZ rampbug fix analysis](https://gist.github.com/zer0k-z/2eb0c230c8f2c62b5c46d36353cf8d8d), ramp bugs in CS2 are primarily caused by tiny, invisible slopes—often no larger than 0.06 units—that form at the edges or intersections of mesh triangles. These micro-slopes are not present in the map's design but are generated upon loading the map, leading to inconsistencies across different CS2 versions. Notably, these bugs became more prevalent following the "Call to Arms" update, which significantly increased their frequency.​
#### Mitigation Strategies
While a definitive fix from Valve is pending, mappers can employ several strategies to minimize the occurrence of ramp bugs:​
- **Use Convex Hull Collision:** Applying convex hull collision physics and tying an entity to the ramp can reduce ramp bugs without causing client-side prediction errors. However, this method, while highly effective, doesn't eliminate all ramp bugs, especially those occurring at the end of ramps.​
- **Implement Server-Side Plugins:** Plugins that intercept movement functions like TryPlayerMove and CategorizePosition can adjust player movement to avoid ramp bugs. These plugins work by detecting potential bug scenarios and slightly repositioning the player to maintain momentum. It's important to note that while effective, this approach may introduce prediction errors for players with high latency.

<br>
<br>

### Ramp Types
The following is a list of basic ramp types, these types can be combined and merged as well as used individually - e.g. a curved vertical ramp with a trapezoid end.
<br>
<br>
*Note - full and inverted ramp variants can be easily created by mirroring a half ramp, so it is best to create whatever ramp you desire as a half ramp, and then duplicate as neccessary to reduce repeated work.*

### Ramp Construction
#### Size & Steepness
To Include:
- How size and steepness impacts a map (must be > 45 degrees)
- Examples of sizes of ramps on well known maps
- Recommended sizes and height / width ratios

<br>
<br>

#### Straight Ramps
1. For straight ramps, constructing ramps anti-rampbug is relatively straight forward. Create a simple ramp segment by placing a rectangular block *(LShift+B)*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/make_block_square.gif "Using LShift+B to place a rectangular block.")

2. Use the clip tool *(LShift+X)* to cut the block into a triangle, ensure `cap new surfaces` is enabled.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/cut_block.gif "Cut block to ramp shape.")

3. Extend the ramp to the desired length using the selection tool *(LShift+S)*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/extend_body.gif "Extend the ramp to desired size.")

4. Select the surfable surfaces of the ramp in `face mode` and copy them *(Ctrl+C)*
Then select the ramp in `mesh mode` and hide it with `quickhide` *(H)*.
Then paste the faces you copied with `paste special` *(Ctrl+LShift+V)* (You don't need to alter any paste settings you can just click `ok`)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/copy_surface_paste_special_hide_ramp_body.gif "Copy and paste faces, and hide ramp body.")

5. Search for and find the `toolsplayerclip` material in the `material browser`, and apply it to the faces *(LShift+T)*

![alt text](https://github.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/blob/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/apply_toolsplayerclip.gif "Apply the 'toolsplayerclip' material.")

6. Use the `thicken faces` *(G)* tool to increase the thickness to `2 units`. Ensure `from center` is disabled.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/thicken_clip_faces.gif "Thicken the faces of the ramp clip")

7. Select the clip in `mesh mode` and in the `object properties` menu change the `physics type` from `Default` to `Mesh`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/change_clip_phys_deafult_to_mesh.gif "Change clip physics type to mesh.")

8. Ensure the clip is selected in `mesh mode`, unhide the ramp body *(U)* and hide the clip *(H)*. Select the ramp body in `mesh mode`. In the `object properties` menu change the `physics type` from `Default` to `None`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/change_ramp_body_phys_to_none.gif "Change ramp body physics type to none.")

9. Select the bottom and end cap faces of the ramp body. Use `copy` *(Ctrl+C)* and `paste special` *(Ctrl+LShift+V)* to duplicate the faces. Apply the `toolsplayerclip` material *(LShift+T)*, and then in `mesh mode`, change the `physics mode` of this clip from `None` to `Mesh`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/clip_end_caps_and_change_phys_to_mesh.gif "Clip end caps and bottom and change physics to mesh.")

10. Now you can unhide all the ramp components *(U)* and your ramp is ready to be surfed.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/straight_ramp/unhide_all.gif "Unhide all components.")

The straight ramnp is now complete and ready to be surfed on.

<br>
<br>

#### Vertically Curved Ramps
Creating a curved ramp, either vertically or horizontally curved is a little more complicated, but still easy if you follow this method closely.
1. Create and cut a single ramp segment using the straight ramp method ([steps 1 & 2](#straight-ramps))

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/make_block_square.gif "Using LShift+B to place a rectangular block.")
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/cut_block.gif "Cut block to ramp shape")

2. Duplicate this segment *(LShift+ArrowKey)*. Enter `rotation mode` *(R)* and select the duplicated ramp segment. Center the `rotation pivot` in the selection *(Alt+Home)* and rotate the segment.
   Select all the vertices of the rotated segment in `vertex mode` *(Double Click)*, and drag the bottom corner vertex to align with the original ramp segment in the `2D Side View`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/duplicate_and_align_first_segment.gif "Duplicate, rotate and align the bottom-corner vertex of the ramp segment.")

3. Repeat step 2, selecting all the ramp segments when duplicating, and all the vertices when aligning. Ensure the rotation amount is consistent between each ramp segment. *(The example uses 5° per ramp segment)*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/create_more_duplicated_segments_and_align.gif "Repeat steo 2, until desired ramp length is met.")

4. Select the surfable surfaces of the ramp in `face mode` and copy them *(Ctrl+C)*
Then select the ramp in `mesh mode` and hide it with `quickhide` *(H)*.
Then paste the faces you copied with `paste special` *(Ctrl+LShift+V)* (You don't need to alter any paste settings you can just click `ok`)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/duplicate_faces_and_hide_ramp_body.gif "Select, and duplicate the ramp body faces, and hide the ramp body meshes.")

5. Search for and find the `toolsplayerclip` material in the `material browser`, and apply it to the faces *(LShift+T)*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/apply_toolsplayerclip.gif "Apply the toolsplayerclip material to clips.")

7. In `edge mode` select the interior edges of the ramp segments. In the `Editing` menu, switch to `Use selection's local space axes for gizmo`. Ensure your `grid size` is 1 - 8 units, and use the `translate` tool to slide the edges so that the faces overlap once, and the top vertices are almost touching.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/translate_edges.gif "Translate edges along clip body surface.")

7. Use the `thicken faces` *(G)* tool to increase the thickness to `2 units`. Ensure `from center` is disabled.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/thicken_faces.gif "Thicken faces of clip surface.")

8. Select the clips in `mesh mode` and in the `object properties` menu change the `physics type` from `Default` to `Multiple Convex Hulls`. Then select the mesh of the first ramp clip, and change its `physics type` from `Multiple Convex Hulls` to `Mesh`

*Note, 'the first ramp clip' is the clip at the start of the ramp, where start and end are defined by the direction the ramp will be surfed when playing the map.*

*Note, if your curved ramp contains both long straight section(s) and curved section(s), ensure the ramp clip(s) for the straight section(s) have `Physics Type` set to `Mesh`.*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/change_ramp_clip_physics_and_end_clip_physics.gif "Change physics clip physics types.")

9. Ensure the ramp clips are selected in `mesh mode`, now unhide the ramp body *(U)*, and hide the clip surfaces *(H)*. Then delete every second segment *(Del)*, and the interior facing faces of the remaining segments.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/hide_clip_and_delete_body_intermediate_segments.gif "Unhide ramp body, hide clips and delete interval segments.")

10. In `edge mode`, select the adjacent `open loops` of edges between the deleted interior faces *(LShift+Double Click)*. Create an `interpolated bridge` between the `edge loops` *(Alt+B)*.
Ensure `twists` is set to `0` and `steps` is set to `1`. Press enter to confirm. Repeat this for all of the gaps in the ramp.
If you have an even number of segments, you must then delete all the faces of the final segment and then bridge the remaining final gap.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/bridge_edges.gif "Bridge the ramp segments")<br>

*Note, if your ramp body is made of an even number of segments, you will have to delete the faces of the end segment and bridge them like in the gif below*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/even_segments_last_piece.gif "Bridge final segment of even number of segment ramp.")

11. Now select the ramp body in `mesh mode`. In the `object properties` menu change the `physics type` from `Default` to `None`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/change_ramp_body_phys_to_none.gif "Change the ramp body physics to none.")

12. Finally, select the bottom and end cap faces of the ramp body. Use `copy` *(Ctrl+C)* and `paste special` *(Ctrl+LShift+V)* to duplicate the faces. Apply the `toolsplayerclip` material *(LShift+T)*, and then in `mesh mode`, change the `physics mode` of this clip from `None` to `Mesh`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/curved_ramp/clip_end_and_bottom_and_change_phys.gif "Clip end and bottom of ramp body.")

You can now unhide all the components *(U)* and use the completed ramp. Ensure the if you move or rotate the ramp, that you select **ALL** components.

### Ramp Design & Aesthetics
#### Ramp Consistency
​Incorporating consistent materials and colors for interactive surfaces, such as end platforms, ramps, and bhoppable areas, is essential for intuitive navigation. This consistency allows players to quickly recognize and interact with these elements, enhancing their overall experience. By differentiating these materials and colors from the rest of the map, you create clear visual cues that guide players seamlessly through the environment. ​It is of course, not strictly neccessary, or required, but in general makes it easier for players to learn the routes and limits of the map.

#### Decorating Ramps
Utilizing tools like the face cut tool and beveling techniques enables the creation of intricate patterns and designs on curved ramp surfaces. These methods not only add aesthetic appeal but also contribute to a more immersive and engaging gameplay environment.
Similar effects can be achieved by well-designed custom textures, or by modelling workflows through blender, but that is outside the scope for this guide. Many tutorials and guides for this can be found on youtube.

*View here the `face cut tool` *(C)*, to cut an indent into the faces of the ramp surface.*

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/ramp_decoration/cut_faces.gif "Cut ramp surface.")

*And then using `local selection axis` the faces can be indented and duplicated to make a window into the ramp.*

# Map Design
### Obstacles
Here is a list of obstacles you might wish to include into your map.
<br>
<br>

#### Spin
A normal spin will only allow the player to turn in one direction.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chent-AU/CS2-Surf-Mapping/refs/heads/main/media/gifs/obstacles/spin.gif "Default Spin")
<br>
<br>

#### Royal Spin
A royal spin will force the player to change the direction of their rotation part way into the spin.

<br>
<br>

#### Drop Strafe
A drop strafe will allow the player to strafe left and right instead of spinning (assuming there is enough room).

<br>
<br>

#### Window
A window can be used as a speedcheck, or as a precision test depending on its height, distance and size. It can be made bhoppable or can be made to reset the player if they do not pass through cleanly.

<br>
<br>

#### Ramp Strafes
Ramp strafes can be added to make maintaining units more difficult or to make the setup to jumps more precise.

<br>
<br>

#### Pillars / Air Strafes
Pillars (Or any other object / obstacle) can be used to force the player to strafe through the air.
